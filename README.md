## Killer Button\! \(Jaws? hehe\)

<img src="Down.gif">
</div>

### Description

Don't worry, it doesn't kill your system or anything, it's for those "Yes/No" or "Register Now?" boxes, or just for a laugh!!

If the user clicks "no" (or yes if you swap them) then the other button gets angry and goes after your cursor, with a snarl on its face and eyes that watch you! But don't worry! he's confined to the form.. or is he?
 
### More Info
 
Ermm.. a program to put it in? lol

or it could be standalone of course

How to have a laugh :) and using VB could be useful

A definate 'Yes' to registering, lol!

The engines are a little long at the moment, and on my system there are a few glitches with VB changing images, though i do have a Very slow computer....
