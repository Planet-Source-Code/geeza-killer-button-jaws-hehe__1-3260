*.Gif files		Face pictures, used in Killerbutton version 2
KillerButton.frm	Version 1 of KillerButton, no pictures but it
			sets the button's parent to NONE, graphical
			buttons mess up when i do this
KillerButtonV2.frm	Version 2 of KillerButton, includes the
			'snarling face'.  But it has an awful looking
			engine, i'll fix it when i have time :)
Killer~3.frx		Picture file for version 2

If you can't open these (i wrote them in VB6, but it shouldn't matter)
just use notepad to open them, it's really easy to see how they're
stored, so you can re-create them in any version of VB you like
